Got a web site? Post links to it on social networks? Wish
[comments/replies](http://indiewebcamp.com/comment),
[likes](http://indiewebcamp.com/like), and
[reshares](http://indiewebcamp.com/repost) showed up on your site too? Brid.gy
copies them back for you.

Brid.gy uses [webmentions](http://www.webmention.org/), which are a part of the
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) ecosystem, so your site will need to accept
webmentions for Brid.gy to work with it. Check out some of the
[existing implementations](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#Implementations)!

TODO
---

* add twitter favorites. looks like there are two options:
  * use twitter's Streaming API + app engine backends + app engine socket API
    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/messages#Events_event
    https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/backends/
    https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/
  * scrape twitter's HTML. it'd be the favorited_popup:
    https://twitter.com/i/activity/favorited_popup?id=415371781264781312
* store and render 'skipped' targets. (test: http://instagram.com/p/hc1xLpp72X/)
* replace t.co links with url entities
* move fetching replies (the fetch_replies kwarg to get_activities()) to
  activitystreams-unofficial
* handle 401 Unauthorized response from Twitter in Poll and disable source

Lower priority:

* detect updated comments and send new webmentions for them
* implement the other direction: convert incoming webmentions into API calls to
  post them as comments, etc.
* only handle public posts? (need to add privacy/audience detection to
  activitystreams-unofficial)
* clear toast messages?

Optimizations:

* cache some API calls with a short expiration, e.g. twitter mentions
* cache webmention discovery
* cache served MF2 HTML and JSON with a short expiration. ideally include the
  cache expiration in the content.
* ...and/or serve the comments (and activities?) directly from the datastore.
  drawback is that we don't get updated content.
* detect and skip non-HTML links before downloading, maybe with a HEAD request?
