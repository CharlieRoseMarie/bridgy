Got a web site? Post links to it on social networks? Wish
[comments/replies](http://indiewebcamp.com/comment),
[likes](http://indiewebcamp.com/like), and
[reshares](http://indiewebcamp.com/repost) showed up on your site too? Brid.gy
copies them back for you.

Brid.gy uses [webmentions](http://www.webmention.org/), which are a part of the
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) ecosystem, so your site will need to accept
webmentions for Brid.gy to work with it. Check out some of the
[existing implementations](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#Implementations)!
