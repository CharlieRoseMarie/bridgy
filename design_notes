lots of current hacks and hard-codings of FacebookPage and WordpressSite instead
of using PolyModel for sources and dests. e.g. searching for dests in comment
propagation, querying for the current user's sources and dests.

used to handle current user by storing sources and dests in props on the user.
not any more, just hard coded.
