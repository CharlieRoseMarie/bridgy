<!-- General -->
<li id="what" class="question">What is this?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Bridgy copies comments, likes, reshares, and event RSVPs from social networks
to your web site. If you post links to your site on social networks
(aka <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>ing to
the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/silos">silos</a>), and people interact with
those links, Bridgy <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed">backfeeds</a>
those interactions to your site.
<a href="https://snarfed.org/2013-12-07_goodbye-penny-arcade-report#comments">You
can see an example here.</a>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://snarfed.org/2012-01-08_bridgy_launched">first version of
Bridgy</a> was released a couple years ago, but only supported backfeeding
comments to
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. This version is better, thanks to
<a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmentions</a> and the inspiration of the
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">IndieWeb community</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li id="how" class="question">How does it work?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
When you add one of your accounts, Bridgy checks it periodically for posts and
responses to those posts. When it finds a new response, it
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/original-post-discovery">looks for links to
your web site</a> in the post, then
sends <a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmentions</a> to those links. It
also translates the comment
to <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2 HTML</a>
so that your web site can fetch and parse it.
</p>
<p>Bridgy is <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy">open source</a>. It's
written in Python and runs on
<a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins">oauth-dropins</a> to let
users connect to the silos,
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial">activitystreams-unofficial</a>
to fetch data from the silos and convert it to a standard format, and
<a href="https://github.com/vrypan/webmention-tools">webmention-tools</a> to
send webmentions.
</p>
</li>

<li id="how" class="question">How much does it cost?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Nothing! I have a <a href="http://quip.com/">great day job</a>, and Bridgy
is small, so thanks to <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">App Engine</a>, it
doesn't cost much to run. I don't need donations, promise.
</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to
contribute, <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy">jump into the code</a>
and send me a pull request, or feel free to donate to the
<a href="http://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> or the
<a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> in my name.
</p></li>

<li id="which" class="question">Which things does it send, specifically?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Bridgy detects and sends webmentions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter @-replies, retweets, and favorites of your tweets.</li>
<li>Facebook comments and likes on your posts...but not reshares of them,
  unfortunately. I haven't yet found a way to get those from Facebook's
  API.</li>
<li>Facebook event RSVPs. <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/rsvp">Details.</a></li>
<li>Google+ comments, +1s, and reshares of your posts.</li>
<li>Instagram comments and likes on your pictures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</p></li>

<li id="privacy" class="question">What do you do with my data?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Nothing! Bridgy isn't a business, and never will be, so I don't have the same
motivations to abuse your data that other services might. More concretely, I
won't ever send you email, I store as little of your
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">PII</a>
(personally identifiable information) as possible, and I <em>never</em> have
access to any of your passwords.
</p>
</li>

<li id="who" class="question">Who are you? Why did you make this?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
I'm <a class="h-card" href="https://snarfed.org/">Ryan Barrett</a>. I'm just a
guy who <a href="https://snarfed.org/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site">likes
the web</a> and likes <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">owning his own
data</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li id="history" class="question">How long has this been around?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
I started working on Bridgy in the summer of 2011 and launched the first version
on Jan. 8 2012, which never got much adoption because it was WordPress only and
not very polished. I launched the current version with webmention support on Dec.
9 2013.
</p>
</li>

<li id="stats" class="question">How big is this?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>On March 11 2014, 3 months after its relaunch, Bridgy had:
<ul>
<li>155 users: 72 Twitter, 35 Google+, 34 Facebook, 14 Instagram</li>
<li>Seen 56,142 total responses (comments, retweets, likes, RSVPS, etc.)</li>
<li>Sent 4,576 successful webmentions to 702 different posts on 39 domains</li>
<li>Inspected 50k (estimated) pages for webmention endpoints</li>
</ul></p>
</li>

<li id="disconnected" class="question">Bridgy stopped working for me!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Does your Bridgy user page have a
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pause"></span> icon on it? If so, Bridgy has
lost access to your account. This can happen when you change your password, when
Bridgy's access expires or is revoked, or for other reasons.</p>
<p>To fix this, just click on the
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pause"></span> icon on your user page.
</p></li>

<li id="facebook-expired" class="question">Bridgy used to work with my Facebook
  account, but now it doesn't!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/roadmap/completed-changes/offline-access-removal/">only
lets apps access your account for two months at a time</a>. That time period
automatically extends when you interact with an app yourself, but Bridgy works
in the background, without user interaction. So, you'll need to come back every
two months and log into Facebook again to renew its access to your account.</p>

<p>Don't worry! You don't need to remember to do this yourself. Bridgy will send
you a notification on Facebook when you need to renew. Just click on the
notification, and you'll be set for another two months.
</p></li>

<li id="bug" class="question">I found a bug! I have a feature request!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Great! Thank you! Feel free
to <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues">file it in GitHub</a>,
or <a href="https://snarfed.org/about">send me an email</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li id="domain" class="question">Brid.gy? Really?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Yeah, I know. I'm not proud of the cutesy domain name either. Just go with it.
</p>
</li>


<!-- Listen -->
<br />
<h3 id="listen">Pulling back responses</h3>

<li id="realtime" class="question">Bridgy isn't seeing one of my comments or
  likes or reshares!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Bridgy doesn't work in realtime, it just checks your accounts for new
activity periodically, every 5 to 20 minutes or so depending on the site.
Twitter favorites and retweets used to be an exception, since Bridgy used
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter's Streaming
API</a> for a while, but
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/57">not any more</a>.
</p></li>

<li id="public" class="question">...but it's been a long time, and Bridgy
  still hasn't seen it</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Did you write the original post yourself? Bridgy doesn't crawl other people's
posts, even if they have links to your web site. It only sends back responses
to <em>your</em> posts.</p>
<p>Is the post fully public? And the response too? Bridgy only shows and sends
webmentions for fully public posts and responses. If your default Facebook
audience is "friends" or "friends of friends," or your Twitter account
is <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/users#protected">protected</a>,
or your Google+ post wasn't sent to "public," Bridgy won't see it.
</p>
<p>Instagram is the one exception. The Instagram API
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/instagram-api-developers/DAO7OriVFsw">doesn't
expose</a> whether an account
is <a href="http://help.instagram.com/448523408565555">private</a>, so Bridgy
handles all Instagram photos and comments. If your Instagram account is private,
don't sign it up for Bridgy!
</p></li>

<li id="twitter-replies" class="question">Bridgy isn't seeing one of my Twitter
  replies!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Does that reply include an
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14023-what-are-replies-and-mentions">@-mention</a>
of the user it's replying to? Twitter's API
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/10056">doesn't have a way to get a
tweet's replies</a>, so Bridgy searches for @-mentions of the tweet's author to
find its replies. That means it can't always find replies that omit the
@-mention.
</p></li>

<li id="appspot" class="question">What are all these brid-gy.appspot.com links
in the responses that Bridgy sends to my site?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Short answer: your
server's <a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmention</a> code is probably
rendering the webmention source URL. It should instead use the source
page's <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Properties">microformats2
u-url property</a>. This is a common oversight, since they're usually the same,
but Bridgy is a special snowflake. :P You might want to file a bug against your
server, or even fix it
yourself. <a href="https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/160">Here's an example
discussion.</a>
</p>
Longer answer: Webmentions</a> don't include the actual content of the response,
just a link to it. The recipient fetches that link and extracts the content and
other data using
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>. The
social networks don't (yet) support microformats2, so Bridgy translates their
data to microformats2 HTML and serves those translations as webmention targets
so that recipients can fetch and parse them.
<p>
</p></li>

<li id="ssl" class="question">OK, fine. But why brid-gy.appspot.com instead of
brid.gy?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>It's an SSL thing. The <a href="https://www.brid.gy">brid.gy</a> domain fully
supports and uses SSL, but it uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI</a>, a newer
SSL feature that some older clients and libraries have trouble with. Modern
browsers are generally fine, but when Bridgy sends a webmention, the
server that receives it also needs to understand SNI,
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/20">and some</a>
<a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/14">still don't</a>.
<a href="https://appspot.com/">appspot.com</a>'s SSL doesn't use SNI, so we use
it for webmention sources in order to be as compatible as possible.
</p></li>


<!-- Publish -->
<br />
<h3 id="publish">Publishing</h3>

<li id="publishing" class="question">What do you mean, <em>publishing</em>?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>People often post something on their web site, then post a link to it on
Facebook or Twitter so that other people will see it. The
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWeb</a> community calls this
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>. There are
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">lots of different reasons</a> to do this,
but one of the biggest is <em>owning your data</em>. Bridgy lets you do this
faster, more effectively, and even automatically!</p>
<p>You can try it right now. Once you're signed up to publish, plug the URL for
one of your posts into the text box on your Bridgy user page, then hit
the <em>Preview</em> button. You'll see a preview of what your post would look
like as a Facebook post or Twitter tweet. If you like it, click <em>Send</em>
and Bridgy will post it for you.</p>
<p>It's not just for posts or tweets, either! You can use Bridgy to publish
Twitter <a href="#reply">@-replies</a>,
<a href="#repost">retweets</a>, and
<a href="#like">favorites</a> and Facebook
<a href="#reply">comments</a>,
<a href="#like">likes</a>, and even
<a href="#rsvp">event RSVPs</a>!
</li>

<li id="microformats" class="question">How does it decide which parts of my web
  page to include?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Magic! Most major blog engines and CMSes are supported out of the box, no
setup necessary. Bridgy looks for
<a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> in your HTML, first
the
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>
<code>e-content</code> class and then the legacy <code>entry-content</code>
class. It also understands more advanced microformats2 classes like
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to"><code>in-reply-to</code></a>,
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/like"><code>u-like-of</code></a>, and
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/rsvp"><code>p-rsvp</code></a>. Here's an example:

<pre>&lt;div class="<span class='mf2-keyword'>h-entry</span>"&gt;&lt;p class="<span class='mf2-keyword'>e-content</span>"&gt;
  <span class='mf2-content'>Two naked tags walk into a bar. The bartender exclaims, "Hey, you can't come in here without microformats, this is a classy joint!"</span>
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<li id="webmentions" class="question">Can I do this automatically, whenever
  I post something new on my web site?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Definitely! Just send a <a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmention</a>.
Your server may be sending them already! Webmentions are pretty
new, but <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#Publishing_Software">more
and more web servers</a> are adding support for them. If you're not sure whether
your server can send them, feel free
to <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC">ask on #indiewebcamp</a>, or you can
even write a script to
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#How_to_Test_Webmentions">send them
yourself</a>. It's just a single HTTP request!
</p>
<p>Bridgy has two webmention endpoints, <code>brid.gy/publish/facebook</code> and
<code>brid.gy/publish/twitter</code>. You can use one or both, depending on
which social network you want to publish to. If your server sends webmentions,
just include one or both of these invisible links in your post to publish
automatically!
<pre>&lt;a href="<a href='http://brid.gy/publish/facebook'>http://brid.gy/publish/facebook</a>"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="<a href='http://brid.gy/publish/twitter'>http://brid.gy/publish/twitter</a>"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<li id="reply" class="question">How do I comment on a Facebook post or reply
  to a Twitter tweet from my web site?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
Easy! Put the comment or reply in a new post on your web site, and include a
link to the post or tweet you're replying to with class
<code><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-in-reply-to">
u-in-reply-to</a></code>, as if you were publishing a normal
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/comment">IndieWeb reply</a>. For example:

<pre>&lt;div class="<span class='mf2-keyword'>h-entry</span>"&gt;
  &lt;p class="<span class='mf2-keyword'>e-content</span>"&gt;<span class='mf2-content'>@schnarfed Highly entertaining. Please subscribe me to your newsletter.</span>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;a class="<span class='mf2-keyword'>u-in-reply-to</span>" href="<a href='https://twitter.com/schnarfed/status/448205453911015425'>https://twitter.com/schnarfed/status/448205453911015425</a>"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

The link doesn't need to have any visible text in it. However, if you're replying to a
tweet, you do need to
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14023-what-are-replies-and-mentions">@-mention</a>
its author. Then publish your post via the Bridgy UI or a webmention like
normal!
</p>
</li>

<li id="like" class="question">How do I like a Facebook post, favorite or
  retweet a tweet, or RSVP to an event from my web site?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
Liking, RSVPing, favoriting, and retweeting are almost exactly the
<a href="#reply">same as replying</a>. The only difference is that you use
<code><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/like">u-like-of</a></code>
for a like or favorite,
<code><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/repost">u-repost-of</a></code> for a
retweet,
or <code><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/rsvp">p-rsvp</a></code> for an
RSVP.

</li>

<li id="silos" class="question">Why only Facebook and Twitter? Why not Google+ or
   Instagram?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Sadly, <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/api/">Google+'s API</a>
doesn't support posting or commenting, and
<a href="http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/#post_media_comments">Instagram's API</a>
requires
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNydmNsUUlEUGdySWFWbGpQczdmWnc6MQ">manual approval</a>
