<li class="question">What is this?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Brid.gy copies comments, likes, and reshares from social networks to your web
site. If you post links to your site on social networks
(aka <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>ing to
the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/silos">silos</a>), and people interact with
those links, Brid.gy <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed">backfeeds</a>
those interactions to your site.
<a href="http://snarfed.org/2013-12-07_goodbye-penny-arcade-report#comments">You
can see an example here.</a>
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://snarfed.org/2012-01-08_bridgy_launched">first version of
Brid.gy</a> was released a couple years ago, but only supported backfeeding
comments to
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. This version is better, thanks to
<a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmentions</a> and the inspiration of the
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">IndieWeb community</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li class="question">How does it work?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
When you add one of your accounts, Brid.gy checks it periodically for posts and
comments on those posts. When it finds a new comment on a post, it
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/original-post-discovery">looks for links to
your web site</a> in the post, then
sends <a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmentions</a> to those links. It
also translates the comment
to <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2 HTML</a>
so that your web site can fetch and parse it.
</p>
<p>Brid.gy is <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy">open source</a>. It's
written in Python and runs on
<a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins">oauth-dropins</a> to let
users connect to the silos,
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial">activitystreams-unofficial</a>
to fetch data from the silos and convert it to a standard format, and
<a href="https://github.com/vrypan/webmention-tools">webmention-tools</a> to
send webmentions.
</p>
</li>

<li class="question">How much does it cost?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Nothing! I have a <a href="http://quip.com/">great day job</a>, and Brid.gy
is small, so thanks to <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">App Engine</a>, it
doesn't cost much to run. I don't need donations, promise.
</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to
contribute, <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy">jump into the code</a>
and send me a pull request, or feel free to donate to the
<a href="http://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> or the
<a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> in my name.

<li class="question">Which things does Brid.gy send, specifically?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Brid.gy detects and sends webmentions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter @-replies, retweets, and favorites of your tweets.</li>
<li><em>Your</em> Twitter favorites of other people's tweets.</li>
<li>Facebook comments and likes on your posts...but not reshares of them,
  unfortunately. I haven't yet found a way to get those from Facebook's
  API.</li>
<li>Google+ comments, +1s, and reshares of your posts.</li>
<li>Instagram comments and likes on your pictures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</p></li>

<li class="question">Someone commented (or liked or reshared) my post, but
  Brid.gy hasn't seen it yet!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Brid.gy doesn't work in realtime; it just checks your accounts for new
activity every 15 minutes or so. Twitter favorites are the one exception;
Brid.gy usually sees and handles those within seconds. It may expand to
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/18">handle more data in
realtime</a> in the future from more of the sites, but it will probably never
be 100%.
</p></li>

<li class="question">Brid.gy is ignoring one of my Twitter replies!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Does that reply include an
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14023-what-are-replies-and-mentions">@-mention</a>
of the user it's replying to? Twitter's API
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/10056">doesn't have a way to get a
tweet's replies</a>, so Brid.gy searches for @-mentions of the tweet's author to
find its replies. That means it can't find replies that omit the @-mention.
</p></li>

<li class="question">What are all these brid-gy.appspot.com links in the
comments that Brid.gy sends to my site?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Short answer: your
server's <a href="http://www.webmention.org/">webmention</a> code is probably
rendering the webmention source URL. It should instead use the source
page's <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Properties">microformats2
u-url property</a>. This is a common oversight, since they're usually the same,
but Brid.gy is a special snowflake. :P You might want to file a bug against your
server, or even fix it
yourself. <a href="https://github.com/idno/idno/issues/160">Here's an example
discussion.</a>
</p>
Longer answer: Webmentions</a> don't include the actual
content of the comment or like or reshare, just a link to it. The recipient
fetches that link and extracts the content and other data using
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">microformats2</a>. The
social networks don't (yet) support microformats2, so Brid.gy translates their
data to microformats2 HTML and serves those translations as webmention targets
so that recipients can fetch and parse them.
<p>
</p></li>

<li class="question">OK, fine. But why brid-gy.appspot.com instead of brid.gy?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>It's an SSL thing. The <a href="https://www.brid.gy">brid.gy</a> domain fully
supports and uses SSL, but it uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI</a>, a newer
SSL feature that some older clients and libraries have trouble with. Modern
browsers are generally fine, but when Brid.gy sends a webmention, the
server that receives it also needs to understand SNI,
<a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/20">and some</a>
<a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/14">still don't</a>.
<a href="https://appspot.com/">appspot.com</a>'s SSL doesn't use SNI, so we use
it for webmention sources in order to be as compatible as possible.
</p></li>

<li class="question">I found a bug! I have a feature request!</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Great! Thank you! Feel free
to <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues">file it in GitHub</a>,
or <a href="http://snarfed.org/about">send me an email</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li class="question">What do you do with my data?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Nothing! Brid.gy isn't a business, and never will be, so I don't have the same
motivations to abuse your data that other services might. More concretely, I
won't ever send you email, I store as little of your
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">PII</a>
(personally identifiable information) as possible, and I <em>never</em> have
access to any of your passwords.
</p>
</li>

<li class="question">Who are you? Why did you make this?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>
I'm <a class="h-card" href="http://snarfed.org/">Ryan Barrett</a>. I'm just a
guy who <a href="http://snarfed.org/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site">likes
the web</a> and likes <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/why">owning his own
data</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li class="question">Brid.gy? Really?</li>
<li class="answer">
<p>Yeah, I know. I'm not proud of the cutesy domain name either. Just go with it.
</p>
